My research revolves around Computer Vision and Deep Learning as a Senior Engineer I, R&D at <a href="https://www.vasoptic.com/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Vasoptic Medical, Inc.</a>, USA with applications in Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) of the eye. At present, I am based in Maryland, USA. Prior to this, I worked as a Data Analytics Consultant with the same company. I was a Project Guide at Institute of Human Resources Development (<a href="https://ihrd.ac.in/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">IHRD</a>), Kerala, India, before joining Vasoptic Medical Inc. I have experience as a Software Engineer in R&D at <a href="https://vehere.com/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;"> Vehere</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._S._Dasgupta" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Dr. Kankar Shubra Dasgupta</a>. I have worked as a Junior Research Fellow at <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, under the guidance of <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pabitra/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Prof. Pabitra Mitra</a> with funding from Indian Space Research Organisation (<a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">ISRO</a>).

I received my B.Tech. (Honours) degree in <a href="https://ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering</a> from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a> (Kharagpur, WB, India) with a Minor in Physics, and my Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) degree in <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Electrical & Computer Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">Johns Hopkins University</a> (Baltimore, MD, USA).

During my Master's at JHU, I worked on "Development of efficient, autonomous asteroid detection and tracking algorithms on satellite time-series
images, for real-time onboard applications on spacecraft hardware", funded by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">NASA</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/" style="color:#0645AD; text-decoration: none;">JHU Applied Physics Laboratory</a>. At Vehere my major research project was conceptualizing and designing algorithms for Drone (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Detection and Identification for real-time commercial application. At IHRD, I supervised several teams on Deep Learning and Computer Vision R&D projects using Python (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV), C++, MATLAB. My goal is to use Computer Vision and Machine Learning technology to develop and improve human lives for the benefit of society.
